FST_APP for Bioinformatics Course

This app is built to guide students through the process of determining the genetic distance among different populations of fish in Lake Mistassini in Eeyou Istchee. Hopefully, students will be able to use something like this to see the genetic data associated with the fishery that supports a large part of their community's economy.
