# FST_APP
FST_APP for Bioinformatics Course

This app is built to guide students through the process of determining the genetic distance among different populations of fish in Lake Mistassini in Eeyou Istchee. Hopefully, students will be able to use something like this to see the genetic data associated with the fishery that supports a large part of their community's economy. 
Notes:
Some values are reactive even though this seems unnecessary at the moment (for example, the population (sites) checkboxes at the top of the plots tab). This is because at some point, other fish data sets will hopefully be added, and the sites may change, possibly to other nearby geographic locations.
